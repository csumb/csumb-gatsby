As part of the commitment to the improvement of access to information resources and technologies to those with disabilities, the California State University system launched the [Accessible Technology Initiative](http://www.calstate.edu/accessibility/) (ATI) in January, 2006. This commitment is articulated in the January, 2005 [Executive Order 926, the CSU Board of Trustees Policy on Disability Support and Accommodations.](http://www.calstate.edu/EO/EO-926.html)

> _"It is the policy of the CSU to make information technology resources and services accessible to all CSU students, faculty, staff and the general public regardless of disability."_

As evidenced by the [CSUMB Vision Statement](http://csumb.edu/vision), CSUMB is committed to accessibility through innovative pedagogy, technology, and a culture of inclusiveness. It is with this vision that CSUMB embraces ATI as a continuum for the continued development and improvement of an educational model which provides access to a quality education and workplace for all students, faculty, and staff.
