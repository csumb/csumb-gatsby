It is our policy to respond to allegations of copyright violations in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied and is accessible on the Website in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please notify the University’s designated Copyright Agent at:

**Mailing Address**
Chip Lenno, Chief Information Officer  
California State University, Monterey Bay

Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that material is infringing.

Your notification must include the following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; (iii) a description of where the material you claim is infringing is located on the Website, including information reasonably sufficient to permit the University to locate the material; (iv) your address, telephone number and email address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Only DMCA notices should go to the University’s Copyright Agent designated above. Communications regarding other matters directed to that address or DMCA notices that do not comply with the requirements of the DMCA may be ignored.

When a valid DMCA notification is received, we will respond by taking down the offending content. We will then take reasonable steps to contact the owner of the removed content so a counter-notification may be filed. Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, we will generally restore the content in question, unless we receive notice from you, the notifying copyright owner, that a legal action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity. The University may provide copies of such notices to the participants in the dispute or to any other third parties, at our discretion and as required by law.

The University may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate an account holder or user of the Website if he or she is a repeat infringer. If you believe that an account holder or user is a repeat infringer, please follow the instructions above to contact the University’s DMCA Copyright Agent and provide information sufficient for us to verify that the account holder or user is a repeat infringer.
