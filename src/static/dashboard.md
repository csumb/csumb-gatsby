Your dashboard includes **Messages**, **Campus Events**, and a list of **Apps** that are available for you.

## Apps

Apps appear on the top of your Dashboard. These are all apps **assigned** to your account. For example, staff might see different apps than students. If the app you are looking for is not available, try expanding your apps (using the arrow on the right).

Apps that do not integrate with campus systems, or were not set up to be visible to everyone, are under the **More apps** button.

To reorder your apps, expand your apps using the arrow on the right, and click the **Edit order** button.

## Ottercard, print balance, and your account

Everything about your account, including **Ottercard balance**, **print balance**, and account information is now under the **Your account** button on the top of every page of the campus website. Here you can quickly find:

- **Manage account** - Update your password, view your student ID, and see other information about your account.
- **Public profile** - For employees with public directory profiles. Manage your phone, biography, and more.
- **OtterCard** - View your OtterCard balance.
- **Laundry** - See whether there are available laundry machines in your building.
- **Computer labs** - View the number of available computers in labs across campus.
- **Print balance** - How many pages you have left to print on campus. You can also purchase more printer paper.
- **Emergency alerts** - Update your cell number to be notified of critical campus emergencies.
