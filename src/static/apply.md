This page is what is linked from the front page of csumb.edu. And should always have the most up to date information on the application cycle.

Accepting Applications now with a link to CSU Apply when applications are open.

When Applications are not currently open we will have general information about the application cycle and dates of when the next cycle starts.

When applications are not open we will have a spot where they can sign up for the email list so they will be sent emails once the application cycle does open up again.

This will be a project that Web Services will work with Admissions to have the correct information. This page will also live on the admissions site.
