Your name is important, so let's make sure to get it right. Most people have at least two kinds of names: **legal**, and **preferred**. Legal names are only used on diplomas, and for HR things like W-2 forms and paychecks. Your preferred name is used on all online systems on campus, including the campus website, directory, email, learning management, etc.

#Changing your preferred name

When you create or update your preferred name, remember:

- It might take several days for that name change to appear in systems across campus. The change is not immediate.
- Your email address will not change. If you want your email address to change, complete an IT workorder and we can add an "alias" to your account.
- Your preferred name **always** takes prescedence, so if you change your legal name and want that reflected, you need to also update your preferred name.

##If you are a student

Change or add a **preferred** name in OASIS.

##If you are an employee

Change or add a **preferred** name in CMS Employee Resources.

#Changing your legal name

Any legal name change is a bigger deal, so the process involves some forms. Remember that if you have a preferred name already, it will need to also be updated to reflect a legal name change.
