## Cost and timeline

The cost for a single order is $14.45, which includes a magnet mount on the back. Bulk orders are less expensive; six badges would cost $10.86/each. For this reason, the vendor will place bulk orders of approved proofs on the 1st and 3rd Friday of every month.

## Payment

The vendor will contact you and the procurement card holder via email when your order is ready. You may pay by phone or in person. We encourage you to use your department procurement card.
