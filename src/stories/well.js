      <h3>The story of the Pequod</h3>
      <p>
        Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men
        sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a
        wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous,
        off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors,
        goat-like, leaped down the rolling shipâ€™s side into the tossed boats
        below.
