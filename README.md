# 🏄‍♀️ CSUMB Gatsby website

## Dev notes

* ~~Using @emotion-js to render CSS in components~~
* ~~Use https://ui.reach.tech~~
* LET'S USE https://design-system.service.gov.uk/

## TODOs

* We're loading files twice in gatsby-node because there's confusion on how to get contents with filesystem. Should fix that.
* Need to test timing for Netlify
